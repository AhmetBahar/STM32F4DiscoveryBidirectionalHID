STM32F4DiscoveryBidirectionalHID
================================

This project is a fully functional project for the Coocox IDE for the STM32F4Discovery board.

It provides an easy to use 'base' any project you can imagine that needs bidirectional HID USB capabilities.



In addition, I have provided two python programs(one for windows and one for linux) which seemlessly communicate with these project files.
